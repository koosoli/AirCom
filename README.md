# AirCom - ESP32 Tactical Communication System

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTICE**

**This is UNTESTED PROOF-OF-CONCEPT code. No guarantees are provided regarding functionality, stability, or fitness for any purpose. Use at your own risk.**

This repository contains the complete PlatformIO firmware for "Project AirCom," a handheld, off-grid tactical communicator based on the ESP32-S3 and Wi-Fi HaLow.

## üéØ **Project Goal**

The device is a standalone, all-in-one solution that creates a **MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network)**, functioning as a mesh-networked walkie-talkie, text messenger, and an ATAK-compatible location beacon that requires no connection to a mobile phone. It is designed for off-grid communication in scenarios where cellular service is unavailable, such as disaster response, wilderness expeditions, or tactical operations. As a robust, low-power, long-range communication tool, it provides a critical lifeline for teams operating in remote environments, with a key focus on providing high-quality voice communications.

## üìã **Current Status: Conceptual Prototype**

This firmware is an early-stage conceptual prototype. It should not be considered feature-complete or production-ready.

The purpose of this codebase is to provide a complete and robust architectural foundation for the project. The high-level application logic, FreeRTOS task structure, and inter-task communication are all in place. However, the code is untested on real hardware and requires significant work to become a field-ready product.

## üîß **How It Works**

The firmware is built on the ESP-IDF framework and leverages FreeRTOS to manage multiple operations concurrently. Each core function of the device is handled by a dedicated task pinned to a specific CPU core to ensure real-time performance and stability.

### **Core 0 (Protocol Core): Handles all networking and data processing.**

- **networkTask**: Manages the Wi-Fi HaLow mesh network, broadcasting discovery packets and routing outgoing messages.
- **tcp_server_task**: Listens for incoming text messages.
- **atakTask**: Periodically broadcasts the device's position as a CoT message.
- **atak_processor_task**: Listens for incoming CoT packets from teammates and updates their locations.

### **Core 1 (Application Core): Handles real-time peripherals and user interaction.**

- **uiTask**: Manages the OLED display and user input, including a state machine for screen navigation.
- **gpsTask**: Continuously parses data from the GPS module.
- **audioTask**: Manages PTT functionality, including audio capture, encoding (stub), and transmission/reception over UDP.

## üîß **Next Steps & Future Enhancements**

### **Final Implementation**
To create a production-ready binary, a developer must replace the current placeholders with real, hardware-specific drivers and libraries:

- **Integrate the Wi-Fi HaLow SDK**: The HaLowMeshManager component is a wrapper. The vendor-specific SDK must be added and its functions called from the existing methods.
- **Integrate the Opus Codec**: The Opus component is a placeholder. A pre-compiled libopus.a binary and its headers must be added.
- **Implement Production-Grade Encryption**: The crypto.cpp file uses placeholder functions. A trusted library like libsodium must be integrated for real security.
- **Testing and Debugging**: The entire system must be tested on the target hardware.

### **Implemented Features**
- **Bluetooth Headset Support**: ‚úÖ Implemented Bluetooth HFP (Hands-Free Profile) for wireless headsets with audio routing and device discovery
- **Audio Queue Management**: ‚úÖ Complete audio buffer management with overflow protection and status monitoring
- **Device Discovery**: ‚úÖ Bluetooth device scanning and connection management
- **Audio Streaming**: ‚úÖ Bidirectional audio streaming between device and Bluetooth headset

### **Future Enhancements**
- **Camera & Video Support**: Integrate a camera module (like an ESP32-CAM) to stream low-framerate video or send still images over the HaLow network. This would provide real-time visual intel for ATAK integration, a feature made possible by HaLow's higher bandwidth.
- **Advanced Power Management**: Implement interrupt-driven UI and deep sleep modes to maximize battery life.
- **Canned Messaging**: Add a UI for sending pre-defined messages quickly.

## üîß **Technology Choices & Advantages**

### **Wi-Fi HaLow (IEEE 802.11ah) vs. LoRa**
This project uses Wi-Fi HaLow to optimize for high-throughput applications that can support both data and high-quality voice. This represents a different set of engineering trade-offs compared to popular LoRa-based projects like Meshtastic.

**Bandwidth vs. Range**: While LoRa-based networks often achieve a longer maximum point-to-point range, Wi-Fi HaLow provides significantly more bandwidth (Mbps vs. kbps). This project prioritizes data rate to support its core features.

**Voice & High-Data Applications**: The primary advantage of HaLow's bandwidth is its ability to support clear, low-latency, high-quality voice streams using codecs like Opus. This is a critical feature for first responders, tactical teams, and airsoft players, but it is very difficult to achieve on lower-bandwidth LoRa networks.

**Standard IP Networking**: As a true IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi standard, HaLow operates as a standard IP network. This simplifies the software stack, enabling the direct use of proven, standard protocols like TCP/IP, UDP, and WPA3 security.

In summary, this project chooses Wi-Fi HaLow as the underlying technology to create a communications platform where high-throughput data and real-time voice are the primary requirements.

### **Protocol Buffers (Protobufs)**
Inspired by projects like Meshtastic, this firmware uses Google's Protocol Buffers instead of JSON for application-layer messaging. This provides a strongly-typed, versionable, and highly compact binary format for all network communication, reducing bandwidth usage and increasing reliability.

## üîß **Building the Firmware**

Ensure you have a working PlatformIO environment with the ESP-IDF toolchain installed.

### **Prerequisites**
- PlatformIO IDE or CLI
- ESP32 development board
- Wi-Fi HaLow module (FGH100M-H recommended)
- USB cable for programming

### **Build Instructions**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd AirCom

# Select your hardware platform in platformio.ini
# Options: xiao_esp32s3, xiao_esp32c3, xiao_esp32c6,
#          heltec_ht_hc32, heltec_ht_it01, generic_heltec

# Build project
platformio run

# Upload to device
platformio run --target upload

# Monitor serial output
platformio device monitor
```

All necessary libraries are included as local ESP-IDF components, so no additional dependencies need to be installed.
