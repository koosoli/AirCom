# Contributing to AirCom

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AirCom! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this project.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This is currently an untested proof-of-concept codebase.** While we welcome contributions, please be aware that:

- The code has not been validated on real hardware
- Significant testing and debugging will be required
- All contributions should be thoroughly tested before submission

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PlatformIO IDE or CLI
- ESP32 development environment (ESP-IDF)
- Git for version control
- Basic understanding of ESP32 and FreeRTOS

### Development Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AirCom
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # Install PlatformIO if not already installed
   pip install platformio

   # Install ESP-IDF (required for ESP32 development)
   platformio platform install espressif32
   ```

3. **Build and test**
   ```bash
   # Build the project
   platformio run

   # Run GUI preview for testing
   .\simple_gui_preview.bat  # Windows
   # or
   ./simple_gui_preview.sh  # Linux/Mac
   ```

## üìã Contribution Process

### 1. Fork and Branch
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Development Guidelines

#### Code Standards
- **Language**: C++11 with C compatibility for ESP-IDF
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names following ESP-IDF conventions
- **Documentation**: Document all public functions and complex logic
- **Error Handling**: Use the provided logging system instead of ESP_LOGX
- **Memory Management**: Follow established callback and memory management patterns

#### Code Structure
```
AirCom/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/                    # Main application
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ include/            # Headers
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.cpp               # Implementation files
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt      # Build configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/            # ESP-IDF components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other project files]
```

### 3. Logging System
Use the project's logging system instead of ESP_LOGX:
```cpp
#include "include/logging_system.h"

// Component-specific logging
LOG_INFO("NETWORK", "Network initialized successfully");
LOG_ERROR("AUDIO", ERROR_NONE, "Audio initialization failed");
LOG_DEBUG("UI", "Button pressed: %s", button_name);
```

### 4. Testing Requirements

#### GUI Preview Testing
- Test all interface screens in the GUI preview
- Verify navigation flows
- Test system simulation scenarios
- Check for UI responsiveness

#### Compilation Testing
- Ensure code compiles on all supported platforms
- Test with different hardware configurations
- Verify no new warnings or errors

#### Code Review
- Self-review your code before submission
- Check for memory leaks and resource management
- Verify thread safety considerations

### 5. Commit Guidelines

#### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Add detailed description for complex changes

**Examples:**
```
Add Bluetooth device discovery functionality
Fix memory leak in audio callback system
Update README with Wi-Fi HaLow configuration
```

#### Commit Structure
```bash
# Make small, focused commits
git add specific-files
git commit -m "Clear commit message"

# Group related changes
git add feature-files
git commit -m "Implement feature X"
```

### 6. Pull Request Process

#### Before Submitting
1. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure no regressions
2. **Update documentation** - Modify README if needed
3. **Check code style** - Follow established patterns
4. **Verify compilation** - Test on supported platforms

#### Pull Request Template

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Component Architecture
- Follow the established plugin-based design pattern
- Use interfaces for hardware abstraction
- Implement proper dependency injection

### Thread Safety
- Use established mutex patterns
- Follow callback safety guidelines
- Implement proper synchronization

### Memory Management
- Use the provided SafeCallback system
- Follow established memory tracking patterns
- Avoid manual memory management where possible

### Error Handling
- Use the logging system for all errors
- Follow established error reporting patterns
- Implement proper error recovery

## üîß Development Tools

### GUI Preview
```bash
# Test interface without hardware
./simple_gui_preview.bat  # Windows
# or
python gui_preview.py     # Cross-platform
```

### Build System
```bash
# Build for specific platform
platformio run --environment xiao_esp32s3
platformio run --environment heltec_ht_hc32

# Clean build
platformio run --target clean
```
